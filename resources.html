            <p class = "justalign">Here, Danielle Wood talks about space innovations that can help take care of the human population if used properly. She works to tear down the barriers that bind many different groups
            of people in order to unify them under the common goal of space exploration.</p>
            <p class = "justalign">Intersectionality is a tool for analyzing how different factors of prejudice and social structures such as class, race, and gender, play into the viewpoints of different groups of people.
            This article helps to show why intersectionality matters in maintaining a healthy workspace and a clean social environment overall.</p>

            <h3 id = "ib">Implicit Bias</h3>
            <p class = "justalign">Here are resources that can help measure your own implicit bias. Implicit bias is defined as a negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, 
                against a specific social group. We often have our own internal judgements of people based on our own experiences, meaning that avoiding the utilization of implicit bias is
            difficult, but not impossible. It plays into the concept of intersectionality as well since historic prejudices held against groups of people can shape their own biases against
            said people for years to come, effectively ravaging any hope of building a civil environment for all.</p>
            <p class = "justalign">The Harvard Implicit Bias Tests contains a comprehensive list of surveys that help measure your own implicit bias. When we took the tests, we were often surprised by how quickly we were 
            tripped up by the tests' many curveballs. The link is below.</p>

            <p class = "justalign">To summarize the above discussion, we go over an example of a society with a lack of intersectionality by examining the case of Native American circuit making.
            We also discuss the use of social media and hashtags to talk about how empowerment can lead to the rise of intersectionality in our society, regardless of its curent societal state.
            Additionally, some feminist involvement was discussed in the mention of how it ties with implicit bias. Overall, it was concluded that the "code of society" plays an important role in
            the reception of intersectionality and the rise of implicit bias, effectively representing how society fluxes between acceptance and denial of groups of people.</p>
